# Problem #1 a success :)
print("Hey, What is your name?")
name = input()

# I just wanted to mention that the code only worked for me
# When I did the name = input() is it because I am declaring the
# name as my variable?? Combing back to python for some reason
# Throws my brain off. Maybe it's because I learned more C++?? not really sure why

print("Hello " + name + " Would you please tell me your age?")

age = int(input()) + 5

print("Hey guess what you'll be! " + str(age))

print("Enter in the number of hours you work in a week.")

hours = int(input())

print("Now enter your hourly wage without the $:")

pay = float(input())

weekly_pay = hours * pay

print("Your gross pay this week is $" + str(weekly_pay) )


# This is an error because you can only
# concatenate a string not a string to number. Not to mention
# you don't have the int() function that converts an input to an integer
# And you have to turn the variable "age" into a functional string
